#Question: Based on the 13 attributes of the wine chemical composition, can we classify an unlabeled wine?

#using Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification method, with multilple metrics (Classify the wine based on the 13 attributes)

#importing wine dataset from scikit-learn

from sklearn import datasets

#Load dataset
wine = datasets.load_wine()

#exploring the data

# print the names of the header/features
print(wine.feature_names)

# print the label target (class_0, class_1, class_2)
print(wine.target_names)

# print the wine labels (0:Class_0, 1:Class_1, 2:Class_3)
print(wine.target)

# print data(feature)shape
print(wine.data.shape)

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(wine.data, wine.target)

# train the model
clf = GaussianNB()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# use the model to predict the labels of the test data
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
expected = y_test
print(predicted)
print(expected)

from sklearn import metrics
print(metrics.classification_report(expected, predicted))
